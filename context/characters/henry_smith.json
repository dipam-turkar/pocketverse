  "1) Character Snapshot": {
    "Name": "Henry Smith (Nora's half-brother)",
    "Role in Story": "Primary villain who orchestrated the separation of Nora from her son Pete. Took Pete to Justin Hunt while Nora was in a coma. Told Nora that Pete died (EP49). Operates from shadows, maintaining facade of concerned family member while plotting against Nora.",
    "Core Want vs Core Need": "WANT: Control of Smith family assets and position; Nora's downfall (implied EP02, EP49). NEED: [UNCERTAIN - motivations not fully explored in EP001-100]",
    "Primary Fear/Vulnerability": "Nora discovering the truth. Being exposed. Nora's competence exceeding his ability to control the narrative (EP49).",
    "Power/Status": "Self-perception: Legitimate family member protecting interests. Others' perception: Concerned brother to Nora (public); viewed with suspicion by those who know him better. True status: Scheming antagonist who committed serious crimes (child abduction, fraud, potentially worse)."
  },
  "2) Voice DNA": {
    "Vocabulary Level": "\n\nCultured, smooth, superficially warm. Uses family terms strategically (\"sister\"). Hides contempt behind politeness. Evidence: \"Her son? He died a long time ago! I watched him take his last breaths, and then I buried him.\" - delivered as if stating fact (EP49).",
    "Sentence Style": "\n\nSmooth, flowing, often with false concern embedded. Uses questions to probe for information while seeming caring. Longer sentences than Nora or Justin - more elaborate, more manipulative.",

    "Swearing/Slang": "\n\nRarely. Too controlled. Insults through implication rather than crude language. Might let contempt slip through word choice (\"that woman\") but generally maintains polished facade.",
    "Humor Type": "\n\nCutting when safe to express. Enjoys others' misfortune privately. Any humor in public is performative warmth.",
