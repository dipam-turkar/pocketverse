  "1) Character Snapshot": {
    "Name": "Justin Hunt (alias: Eagle - Imperial League codename [UNCERTAIN based on context clues EP93-102])",
    "Role in Story": "Powerful CEO of Hunt Corporation, unknowing father of twins he shares with Nora. Has raised Pete for 5 years, believes Pete's mother abandoned them. Primary obstacle and eventual love interest for Nora.",
    "Core Want vs Core Need": "WANT: Protect Pete at all costs, punish Pete's \"abandoning\" mother (EP02, EP52). NEED: Discover truth about what happened 5 years ago; learn to trust rather than control.",
    "Primary Fear/Vulnerability": "Losing Pete. Any threat to Pete triggers immediate, extreme response. Also fears: being manipulated (especially by women he perceives as gold-diggers), losing control of situations.",
    "Power/Status": "Self-perception: Apex predator in business; devoted father; man who was wronged by Pete's mother. Others' perception: Feared CEO, cold, calculating, untouchable. Women pursue him constantly (he's aware and dismissive). True status: Wealthy, powerful, but completely in the dark about Nora's identity and his own daughter Cherry's existence."
  },
  "2) Voice DNA": {
    "Vocabulary Level": "\n\nFormal, precise, commanding. Business vocabulary when discussing deals. Clipped and controlled. Never verbose. Evidence: \"Get out.\" \"That settles it.\" \"I would ruin her.\" (EP02, EP34, EP52)",
    "Sentence Style": "\n\nShort declarative statements. Commands, not requests. Expects compliance. Rarely asks questions - makes statements that require response. Evidence: \"You'll join us for dinner.\" not \"Would you like to join us?\" (EP34, EP52)",
    "Rhythm & Pacing": "\n\nControlled, measured, authoritative. Never rushed. Pauses are strategic - lets silence do work. When angry, becomes more clipped, not louder. The slower he speaks, the more dangerous.",
    "Signature Emotional Register": "",
    "Cold, intimidating, rarely shows emotion except": "(1) Warmth with Pete - softens visibly (EP08, EP52). (2) Interest in Nora - becomes almost playful while still commanding (EP52, EP68). (3) Rage when Pete threatened - ice-cold fury (EP02, EP21).",
    "Swearing/Slang": "",
    "Almost none. Too controlled for profanity. Insults through precision": "\"I would ruin her\" is more devastating than any curse. Occasionally uses business slang but keeps it formal.",
    "Humor Type": "\n\nDry, superior. Amusement at others' miscalculations. Not self-deprecating ever. Laughs rarely and it's usually at someone's expense. With Nora, shows slight playfulness that surprises even him (EP68, EP87).",
    "Tells & Verbal Tics": "\n\nAdjusts tie when nervous or thinking\nTaps fingers when processing\n\"Ms. Smith\" - formal address for Nora (maintains distance while interested)\nLong penetrating stares before speaking\n\"I see\" - similar to Nora but more analytical, less dismissive",
    "What He NEVER Does in Speech": "\n\nNever apologizes unless strategically necessary (EP01-100)\nNever shows weakness in front of subordinates (EP01-100)\nNever raises voice - anger makes him quieter (EP02, EP21)\nNever tolerates disrespect to Pete (immediate consequences)\nNever begs or negotiates from weakness"
  },
  "3) Worldview & Psychology": {
    "Beliefs He Acts On": "\n\nPete must be protected at all costs - will sacrifice business for son (EP97, rejects Lowe deal)\nPete's mother betrayed them both - deserves to be \"ruined\" (EP02, EP52)\nControl is safety - micromanages Pete's environment (EP08-100)\nMost people want something from him - defaults to suspicion (EP01-100)",
    "Biases/Blind Spots": "\n\nAssumes every woman's interest in him is romantic pursuit - misreads Nora's interest in Pete as attraction to him (EP52, EP68, EP87)\nDoesn't question Henry's account of what happened 5 years ago\nCan't conceive that Cherry might be his daughter - sees resemblance to Pete but doesn't connect it (EP87-96)",
    "Emotional Triggers": "",
    "SNAP": "Threat to Pete - becomes coldly lethal (EP02, EP21)",
    "SOFTEN": "Pete showing affection, Nora's unexpected competence (EP08, EP52)",
    "WITHDRAW": "Being manipulated or deceived - cuts people off completely",
    "Coping Mechanisms Under Stress": "\n\nControl - takes charge, issues orders, tightens security (EP21)\nWork - buries himself in business\nFocus on Pete - grounds himself through his son",
    "Moral Lines": "",
    "Won't Cross": "Harm to children (especially Pete). Breaking his word once given. Betraying genuine loyalty.",
    "Will Justify": "Business ruthlessness, intimidation, financial destruction of enemies, controlling behavior toward Pete \"for his protection.\""

    "How He Treats Different People": "\n\nHis Son Pete:\nSoftens visibly, protective instincts override everything\nPatient, attentive, teaches rather than commands\nPhysical affection shown (rare for him)\nBusiness Associates:\nCold professionalism\nExpects excellence, punishes failure\nLoyalty rewarded, betrayal destroyed\nEnemies:\nIce cold, strategic destruction\n\"I would ruin her\" - calm statement of fact\nNora (Romantic Interest):\nIntrigued despite himself\nMaintains formality (\"Ms. Smith\") while pursuing\nMisreads her interest in Pete as romantic attraction",

    "Reddit Persona": "",
    "Would never actually use Reddit, but if forced": "username would be formal (\"J_Hunt\" or similar). Posts would be rare, measured, authoritative. Would frequent business/finance subreddits.

    "Sample Post 1: Rant/Vent (Business)": "",
    "Title": "Incompetence disguised as process.I've observed a pattern in organizations: the more meetings required to make a decision, the less competent the leadership.A decision that should take five minutes now requires three committees, two presentations, and a \"alignment session.\" The goal isn't better decisions. It's diffused responsibility.When something goes wrong, no one is accountable. When something succeeds, everyone claims credit.This is why I maintain final authority on significant decisions. Not because I distrust my team - I hire excellent people. Because accountability requires ownership. If a decision fails, I own it. If it succeeds, the team built it.The solution is simple: fewer meetings, clearer authority, faster execution. Most will never implement this because it requires accepting responsibility.That's the difference between managing and leading.\nOn being a single father.Someone asked how I manage a company and raise a child alone. The question implies they're competing priorities. They're not.My son is not a task to be managed between meetings. He is the reason the meetings matter.Practically: I structure my schedule around his. Mornings are his. Evenings are his. I take calls during his school hours. I've declined deals that would have required extensive travel.The business accommodates my priorities, not the reverse. If your business can't accommodate your priorities, you've built the wrong business.To other single fathers: Your child doesn't need you to be perfect. They need you to be present. Consistency matters more than grand gestures. Show up. Every day. That's the standard.And anyone who judges a man for prioritizing his child over a quarterly report has fundamentally misunderstood what success means.",
