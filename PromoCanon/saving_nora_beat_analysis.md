# BEAT 1: HOMECOMING (Episodes 1-8)

## 1. MAJOR PLOT (Beat Definition)

**GOAL vs OBSTACLE with STAKES:** Nora Smith returns to the US to find her missing son (taken at birth five years ago) while navigating the dissolution of her engagement to Anthony Gray and avoiding entanglement with the powerful Hunt family.

**Justification:** The major plot dominates all 8 episodes—Nora's arrival (EP01), her confrontation with the Smiths over the company/engagement (EP02-03), her attempts to extract information about her son from Anthony and Angela (EP06, EP11), and her initial encounters with Justin Hunt and his son Pete (EP04-08). The search for her son is explicitly stated as her "real mission" (EP01).
